# Welcome to a Debian Stretch Installer Toolset

These utilities allow quick provisioning of hardware with Debian to allow FAST benchmarking, iteration, and product release. Think improved "preseed."

These scripts are VERY detailed and include everything from constructing a squashfs from scratch (using chroot and debootstrap for example) to partitioning the target media. Use with care as these are optimized to do work. 

What's Inside:
  * [debianLiveA8] - Live Debian USB creation scripts including partitioning
  * [debianInstallerA8] - Debian Installer (for permanent install) scripts
